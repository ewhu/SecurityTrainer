**SecurityTrainer** ================ Enterprise-level Rust platform built for comprehensive security awareness training and phishing simulation, empowering organizations to educate employees and fortify their defenses against sophisticated threats. **Description** ----------- SecurityTrainer is a cutting-edge, Rust-based platform designed to provide interactive security awareness training and phishing simulation for employees. This comprehensive solution enables organizations to educate their staff on the latest security threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices, ultimately reducing the risk of security breaches and data compromise. By leveraging Rust's memory safety features and performance capabilities, SecurityTrainer ensures a robust and efficient training environment for employees. ** Feature Set** -------------- SecurityTrainer boasts a robust set of features, including: 1. **Interactive Modules**: Engaging, scenario-based training modules that simulate real-world security threats, such as phishing attacks, social engineering, and ransomware. These modules are built using Rust's async/await syntax, ensuring seamless execution and optimal performance. Example: A phishing simulation module utilizes Rust's `reqwest` crate to send fake phishing emails, while the `tokio` crate handles asynchronous email processing, mimicking real-world phishing attacks. 2. **Phishing Simulation**: A sophisticated phishing simulation engine that generates realistic, targeted phishing emails, leveraging Rust's `rand` crate for randomization and `serde` for data serialization. Example: The phishing simulation engine uses Rust's `regex` crate to parse and analyze employee email interactions, providing real-time feedback and scoring. 3. ** Gamification and Leaderboards**: A gamified training environment that encourages employee participation and healthy competition, utilizing Rust's `serde_json` crate for data serialization and `rocket` crate for web framework integration. Example: The leaderboard feature uses Rust's `diesel` crate for database integration, storing employee training scores and progress. 4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A robust RBAC system that ensures secure access and permission management, leveraging Rust's `oauth2` crate for authentication and `actix-web` crate for web framework integration. Example: The RBAC system utilizes Rust's `bcrypt` crate for password hashing and `jsonwebtoken` crate for token-based authentication. 5. **Real-time Analytics and Reporting**: A comprehensive analytics and reporting engine that provides insights into employee training progress, phishing simulation results, and overall security posture, utilizing Rust's `chrono` crate for date and time manipulation and `serde` crate for data serialization. Example: The analytics engine uses Rust's `csv` crate to generate training reports, providing actionable insights for security administrators. 6. **Integration with Existing Infrastructure**: Seamless integration with existing infrastructure, including Active Directory, LDAP, and HR systems, leveraging Rust's `ldap3` crate for LDAP integration and `winapi` crate for Windows API interactions. **Installation** ------------ To install SecurityTrainer, follow these steps: 1.
